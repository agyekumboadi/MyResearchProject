# Player Performance Analysis in Sports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the source code, workflow diagrams, and analysis outputs from my MSc research project:  
**"Player Performance Analysis in Sports Using Data Analytics"**  

The project applies *machine learning models* to forecast player performance across multiple sports, using a reproducible data pipeline and interpretable models.

## Project Overview

The project investigates how *data-driven methods* can enhance the assessment of sports performance.  
By combining *statistical analysis*, *feature engineering*, and *predictive modelling*, it identifies the *Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)* most strongly associated with high-performing players.

### Key Objectives
* Analyse large-scale multi-sport datasets (Football, Basketball, and Cross-Sport).
* Engineer and select features using statistical correlation and *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)*.
* Apply *Logistic Regression*, *Random Forest*, and *Support Vector Machine (SVM)* for performance prediction.
* Use *SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)* to explain model predictions.
* Evaluate model generalisability across sports.

## Methodology

The project follows the **CRISP-DM framework**:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Define research objectives and KPI requirements.

2. **Data Understanding**  
   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning.

3. **Data Preparation**  
   * Feature engineering (composite KPIs, standardised formats)  
   * Handling missing values  
   * Dimensionality reduction using PCA  

4. **Modelling**  
   * Logistic Regression (linear baseline)  
   * Random Forest (ensemble model)  
   * SVM (non-linear benchmark)  

5. **Evaluation**  
   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC  
   * Cross-sport generalisability tests  

6. **Explainability**  
   * SHAP summary plots for feature importance  
   * SHAP waterfall plots for individual prediction interpretation  


## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation
* scikit-learn – Machine learning models
* SHAP – Explainability
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualisations
* Jupyter Notebook – Interactive development


## Key Findings

* Offensive metrics (goal contribution, goals total, assists, shot accuracy) were the strongest predictors of high player performance.  
* Random Forest (Top 10 features) achieved the best trade-off between accuracy and interpretability (ROC AUC: 0.8719).  
* SHAP analysis improved transparency and model trust by quantifying feature influence.  
* Cross-sport testing confirmed partial generalisability, though context-specific adjustments are required.


## Data and Privacy

* Raw datasets are **not** included to prevent unauthorised reuse.
* All personal or identifiable player information is not included.
* Only aggregated visuals and processed results are shared.
